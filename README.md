# Watchtower
Focused product view of your GitHub organisation. View repositories, pull requests, security vulnerabilities grouped by product.

## Motivation
Working in organisations looking after multiple teams, it was hard to view the health of the product with multiple microservices.
Watch tower provides a lite weight approach to grouping information by product with additional filters.
